Born and raised in Malaysia, I’m currently pursuing a PhD. at the University of Hong Kong. Yet, I am doing my research at RIKEN, Japan. Because as niche as it is, I’m in the field of nuclear physics. That’s not my only passion – I also boulder and am always looking forward for the next route to send!
