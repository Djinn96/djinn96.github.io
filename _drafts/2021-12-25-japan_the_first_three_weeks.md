It’s been 3 weeks since the last post. I think it’s fair to say that I really have to work on my motivation to write. My excuse is that I am still getting used to the new environment, but then again, I had time to go on a day trip to Tokyo so that point is probably moot by now.

Japan is cold, and it will get colder as the new year approaches, though I’m probably saying this because I come from and am used to a tropical climate. Along with the cold also comes dryness which results in the bane of my life – static shocks. I have been consistently shocked every day without fail since I came out of quarantine. The sound of static cling every time I take off my jacket is also starting to fade into the background of my daily routine.

Speaking of routine, It’s been refreshing to finally get out of quarantine, but now that I have work to do, it’s back to the usual 9 to 5 again. Luckily, My apartment’s only 5 minutes walk away, which also gave me an idea. I’ve been starting to jog to my office and back just to get some exercise in and warm up myself at the same time – didn’t even break a sweat!

        Although, I have been trying out things to break the monotony of a weekly routine. Barring the first week of settling down, I’ve been on a hunt for my next regular bouldering gym. First one I’ve found is <a href="http://quail-climbing.com/">Quail Climbing Gym</a> in Nerima! It’s not quite as big as I’d like, but the problems were quite interesting. For newbies, they even have special routes with only marked hand holds. (foot holds are free) Spent my time there as long as I could, but had to call it a day after my grip started to fail me. That’s when I realised the whole transition period has made me weak. Gonna have to start working on my fundamentals to get back in climbing shape!

Also, I took a trip to the famous Tokyo Tower. It was a bit disappointing knowing that there is a newer and taller landmark called the SkyTree, but it was a nice experience nevertheless. The view up there was great, and I even got to get a glimpse of Mount Fuji from there!

            It’s Christmas as I finish up this post, so if you’re reading this on the day I publish it, Merry Christmas! Perhaps I’ll do a bit of sightseeing and spend Christmas the Japanese way – KFC. Cause hey, when in Rome right?

            But I’ll probably return to my routine soon enough, and will also keep an eye out on new things to do. So until then, see you in the next post!
