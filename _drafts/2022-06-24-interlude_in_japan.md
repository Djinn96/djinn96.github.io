            5 months, 2 weeks, and a bit. Not an ideal duration between posts, but I’ll make do. I could make excuses, what with beam time experiments and PhD confirmation going on, but I’d rather take some time to reflect on the last several months.

            The last time I posted, it was right in the middle of winter, experiencing snow for the first time. Now, I sit by my desk, typing away as I curse the sweltering heat. The winds outside taunting me as they billowed but never seem to reach my room.

            I would say that the past few months passed by very quickly, and they truly did. But the past few months have also been my happiest. Unlike Hong Kong, where my upbringing made me feel quite comfortable there, here in Japan, I get to test myself, truly living independently. No friends, no connections, no knowledge of the land, culture and language – and without fail, I pulled out my phone to use Google Translate at my very first interaction with a native speaker in Japan. I’ve travelled around as much as I could, resumed bouldering every week and made time every evening for loved ones. And while some things could be better, I know that I am already quite fortunate where I am.

Minor side note, I’ve also tried starting some personal projects when I have the time. After spending quite some time mulling over the details, I’ve finally decided to put up my shaded relief map of Malaysia in the projects section. With enough luck, I wish to populate my projects page with more items in the near future as well.

Things are also starting to pick up at work. The past 6 months, while slow in the beginning, have really started moving along. The bits and pieces I’ve picked up are starting to come together and make sense to me. While I was able to sheepishly avoid night shifts, participating in beam time experiments has been a tiring, but great opportunity. Perhaps that’s why I’ve been feeling quite poorly lately, and at this point, I think I do need a rest. Fortunately, I already have my flight tickets purchased (at a slight mark up due to current global politics) and a vacation leave approved.

I do hope that the two weeks back to Malaysia will restore much needed momentum for me.
