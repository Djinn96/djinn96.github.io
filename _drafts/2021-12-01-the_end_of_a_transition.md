As I lie in bed typing this out, it’s my last day of quarantine. In less than an hour, I will be allowed to leave these four walls which I have been staring for the past two weeks.

        It’s not all bad. Sure, the apartment is small, but the amenities are more than sufficient. Also got to experience the more techy side of Japan – from heated toilet seats with bidet to shower rooms with dehumidifying and heating features. Truth be told, where I’m staying right now is quite luxurious. Hopefully it hasn’t spoiled me too much now that I have to move to my actual accommodation for the next couple of years.

Never actually expected to be this bored during quarantine. It’s not that I haven’t done this before when I first went to Hong Kong, but I felt much more restless this time around. Maybe I’ve changed or maybe it’s because I had to continue with remote work even during these 2 weeks.

Even though I’ve spent the last two weeks alone, I am quite fortunate to have had good company to tide me over this period of change.

On to the next chapter to see what awaits!
