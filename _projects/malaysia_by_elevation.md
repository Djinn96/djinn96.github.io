            This map was made after taking inspiration of other shaded relief maps made by <a href="https://x.com/joewdavies">Joe Davies</a>. Steps to produce such maps can be be found <a href="https://github.com/JoeWDavies/geoblender">here</a>.

            Four colours were used to shade this map by elevation. These colours were chosen based on the Malaysian flag. Red and white, which are drawn as stripes on the flag, are selected as the middle bands as this brings out the ridges found in the mountainous regions in Sarawak. The Star and Moon in the Malaysian flag is depicted in Yellow, and is thus chosen as the colour to signify the highest regions in Malaysia.

            The size of both East and West Malaysia were kept the same, but both halves were moved closer together for better visualization and comparison of their land area.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tallest peaks from both halves are shown in black. ‘Gunung’ means mountain in Malay, and with a peak height of 4,095 meters, Gunung Kinabalu is one of the tallest mountain to be found on an island.
