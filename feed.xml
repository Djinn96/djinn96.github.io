On the left, 28 words are neatly organized into 2 groups of 14. While on the left, we see numbers 1 to 14 listed in red and blue, which clues us in that the words are to be separated as red in one group and blue in another.</p> <p>We know that each number likely corresponds to a word from the left, but directly using the words does not make much sense. When have you last heard someone used the words &#8216;hoagies&#8217; and &#8216;trionym&#8217;? The words are likely scrambled and needs to be rearranged. For this purpose, I found a nice online <a href="https://www.thewordfinder.com/anagram-solver/">anagram solver</a>.</p> <p>Now I could start with any random word, and maybe this was luck, but I started solving for the word &#8216;hoagies&#8217;, simply because it&#8217;s a word I just do not recognize, and it gave me a curious result.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="164" height="146" data-attachment-id="281" data-permalink="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/2025/03/03/solving-jane-street-feb-2025/image/" data-orig-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image.png" data-orig-size="164,146" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image.png?w=164" data-large-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image.png?w=164" src="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image.png?w=164" alt="" class="wp-image-281" srcset="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image.png 164w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image.png?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 164px) 100vw, 164px"/></figure></div> <p>The solver was able to find a new word by removing the letter &#8216;o&#8217;. At this point, I still wasn&#8217;t sure what it meant, but looking back at the list of numbers on the right, I noticed that 6 of the 12 lines contain the word &#8216;the&#8217;. and so my next course of action was to google &#8216;the geisha&#8217;.</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="624" data-attachment-id="284" data-permalink="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/2025/03/03/solving-jane-street-feb-2025/image-3/" data-orig-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png" data-orig-size="1275,777" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png?w=750" src="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-284" srcset="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png?w=1024 1024w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png?w=150 150w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png?w=300 300w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png?w=768 768w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png 1275w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"/></figure> <p>And here I made the first breakthrough. The first result is a movie, &#8216;Memoirs of a Geisha&#8217;, which matches the line&#8217;7 of a 9&#8242; in the puzzle. Since Geisha fits the blue 9, Memoirs must be a red 7.

This immediately told me two things. One, the top group corresponds to the blue numbers and vice versa. Two, blue words are solved by taking out one letter before unscrambling, while red words are solved after adding an extra word. Since it is easier to solve the blue words, having all the letters I needed, that&#8217;s where I started. &#8216;The 10 5 3&#8217; was &#8216;The Empire Strikes Back&#8217; and &#8216;7 of the 13 6&#8217; became &#8216;Raiders of the Lost Ark&#8217;. At this point, another clue was found. The blue 7 &#8216;admirers&#8217; consisted of the solved word &#8216;raiders&#8217; + &#8216;m&#8217;, while the red 7 &#8216;isomer&#8217; is the solved word &#8216;memoirs&#8217; &#8211; &#8216;m&#8217;. So each number corresponds to a letter, and red or blue denotes if the letter is added or removed. </p> <p>With this, the additional letters needed to solve for red words were constricted to those that the blue words discarded. Anglophones will also notice that the list of phrases on the right are movie titles, which made it easier to try to guess which words went where. After making quick work of the remaining answers, I ordered the letters that were &#8216;given&#8217; and &#8216;taken&#8217; by their numbers to arrive at &#8216;FILMCOMPOSERJW&#8217;, and the final solution, searching this on google, gave me the film composer, John Williams.</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="391" data-attachment-id="288" data-permalink="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/2025/03/03/solving-jane-street-feb-2025/image-5/" data-orig-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png" data-orig-size="1271,486" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png?w=750" src="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-288" srcset="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png?w=1024 1024w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png?w=150 150w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png?w=300 300w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png?w=768 768w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png 1271w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"/></figure> <p>This tracks with the only clue given by Jane Street:</p> <p class="has-text-align-center"><em>[The answer to this puzzle is a proper noun.]</em></p> <p>Additionally, John Williams was also the composer of all 12 movies listed on the right!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Top Score (Give or Take) I&#8217;ve recently found out about an interesting repository of puzzles from Jane Street and decided to try solving the puzzle of the month.

Not an ideal duration between posts, but I&#8217;ll make do. I could make excuses, what with beam time experiments and PhD confirmation going on, but I&#8217;d rather take some time to reflect on the last several months.</p> <p>The last time I posted, it was right in the middle of winter, experiencing snow for the first time. Now, I sit by my desk, typing away as I curse the sweltering heat. The winds outside taunting me as they billowed but never seem to reach my room.</p> <p>I would say that the past few months passed by very quickly, and they truly did. But the past few months have also been my happiest. Unlike Hong Kong, where my upbringing made me feel quite comfortable there, here in Japan, I get to test myself, truly living independently. No friends, no connections, no knowledge of the land, culture and language &#8211; and without fail, I pulled out my phone to use Google Translate at my very first interaction with a native speaker in Japan. I&#8217;ve travelled around as much as I could, resumed bouldering every week and made time every evening for loved ones. And while some things could be better, I know that I am already quite fortunate where I am.</p> <p>Minor side note, I&#8217;ve also tried starting some personal projects when I have the time. After spending quite some time mulling over the details, I&#8217;ve finally decided to put up my shaded relief map of Malaysia in the projects section. With enough luck, I wish to populate my projects page with more items in the near future as well.</p> <p>Things are also starting to pick up at work. The past 6 months, while slow in the beginning, have really started moving along. The bits and pieces I&#8217;ve picked up are starting to come together and make sense to me. While I was able to sheepishly avoid night shifts, participating in beam time experiments has been a tiring, but great opportunity. Perhaps that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been feeling quite poorly lately, and at this point, I think I do need a rest. Fortunately, I already have my flight tickets purchased (at a slight mark up due to current global politics) and a vacation leave approved.</p> <p>I do hope that the two weeks back to Malaysia will restore much needed momentum for me.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" data-attachment-id="240" data-permalink="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/2022/06/24/interlude-in-japan/20220504_170501/" data-orig-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220504_170501.jpg" data-orig-size="3024,2268" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;SM-A805F&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1651683901&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.58&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.00093720712277413&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="20220504_170501" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220504_170501.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220504_170501.jpg?w=750" src="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220504_170501.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-240" srcset="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220504_170501.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220504_170501.jpg?w=2048 2048w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220504_170501.jpg?w=150 150w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220504_170501.jpg?w=300 300w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220504_170501.jpg?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"/><figcaption>Torii of Peace, Hakone</figcaption></figure></div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[5 months, 2 weeks, and a bit.

Which is to say that I&#8217;m not one to check the weather before I leave home. With weather as cold as Japan&#8217;s, I was looking forward to see the one thing I have never experienced in my life &#8211; snow. Since my arrival here in mid November, I have been keeping track of the temperature and weather for weeks. So you can Imagine the excitement I had when the weather forecast mentioned that snow was expected to fall on a early January morning.</p> <p>But it wasn&#8217;t just in the forecast.</p> <p>While I was waiting giddily for snow, there was an unexpected surprise waiting for me as I left my apartment. In almost all fiction material I have read that took place during the winter season, there is a recurring phrase &#8211; &#8220;frosty morning&#8221;. It was on that very morning I was presented with what the phrase meant. All around me as I walked to my lab, there was a slight blueish white tint &#8211; too thin to be a fog, too clean to look like a smog. Even the grass knew that snow was coming. Their colours, a muted brown compared to the green I remembered it to be. It was a serene view, one that I believe kept generations of people staying and tolerating cold climate regions.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="140" data-permalink="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/first_snow-1-2/" data-orig-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/first_snow-1-edited.png" data-orig-size="360,639" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="first_snow-1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/first_snow-1-edited.png?w=169" data-large-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/first_snow-1-edited.png?w=360" src="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/first_snow-1-edited.png" alt="" class="wp-image-140" width="335" height="594" srcset="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/first_snow-1-edited.png?w=335&amp;h=594 335w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/first_snow-1-edited.png?w=85&amp;h=150 85w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/first_snow-1-edited.png?w=169&amp;h=300 169w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/first_snow-1-edited.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px"/></figure></div> <p>An hour before noon it began. Snow drifted in the wind, falling ever so close to the ground but never seem to touch it. I walked to the cafeteria to get lunch. It was cold, my hands were numb, but my mind never seemed to notice that. All through the walk, my arms were raised to shoulder height, letting the snow fall and accumulate on my jacket. Every flake, large and small, seemed to disappear at the touch of my jacket. Still, they looked soft, fluffy, and not at all what I expected based on my limited knowledge from popular culture. Snow didn&#8217;t fall in singular perfectly shaped crystals, they came in clumps, it&#8217;s as if someone tore small pieces of white candy floss and threw them all over the place. I went back to my lab, happy but slightly disappointed that the snow was not the white winter I was promised.</p> <p>All I needed was patience.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="143" data-permalink="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/20220106_155805-2/" data-orig-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_155805-edited.jpg" data-orig-size="1268,2256" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;SM-A805F&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1641484685&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.58&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;80&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.01&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="20220106_155805" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_155805-edited.jpg?w=169" data-large-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_155805-edited.jpg?w=576" src="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_155805-edited.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-143" width="326" height="580" srcset="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_155805-edited.jpg?w=326&amp;h=580 326w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_155805-edited.jpg?w=652&amp;h=1160 652w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_155805-edited.jpg?w=84&amp;h=150 84w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_155805-edited.jpg?w=169&amp;h=300 169w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_155805-edited.jpg?w=576&amp;h=1024 576w" sizes="(max-width: 326px) 100vw, 326px"/></figure></div> <p>Three hours after the snow started to fall, I could tell that the snow was falling harder. Even my limited window view from the office showed me a flurry of white specks shepherded by the wind. Curious, I went back outside to be greeted by a layer of white all around me. the grass was no longer there, replaced by a blanket of snow. The coniferous trees outside now had a top coat, ironically bringing out a bit more colour in them. I took a picture, recorded a short video, and promptly went back to work &#8211; I had a meeting coming up.</p> <p>The thing with places far from the equator is that the length of days can vary wildly, and in the winter, night comes far too soon. As I left the building, the sun was out, but the streetlights illuminated another part of the winter landscape. Again I walked, now looking to get dinner. The familiar view, now dark, but with snow reflecting the streetlight and illuminating the area. I took in the sight as I stepped into the snow &#8211; &#8216;crunch&#8217;. I think I have found a new favourite sound of mine. The crunch of snow, so loud yet so soothing, making their presence announced with every step of mine and leaving a reminder that someone has been here.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="132" data-permalink="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/20220106_194555-2/" data-orig-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_194555-edited.jpg" data-orig-size="2256,3008" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;SM-A805F&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1641498355&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.58&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;2000&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.071428571428571&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="20220106_194555" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_194555-edited.jpg?w=225" data-large-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_194555-edited.jpg?w=750" src="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_194555-edited.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-132" width="254" height="339" srcset="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_194555-edited.jpg?w=254&amp;h=339 254w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_194555-edited.jpg?w=508&amp;h=678 508w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_194555-edited.jpg?w=113&amp;h=150 113w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_194555-edited.jpg?w=225&amp;h=300 225w" sizes="(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px"/></figure></div> <p>Dinner warmed me, just enough to keep out the cold &#8211; or was it my excitement blinding me from it? And as I walked home, I came upon a patch of thick snow. Of course I am going to build a snowman, can&#8217;t let this opportunity get away. So I put on my gloves and got down to it. Granted I had no prior experience of building one, I was surprised that my little one managed to hold itself up, long enough for me to get a picture of it. But there was more snow around, so I tried the next thing I could, throwing snowballs. Turns out throwing snow is a lot like throwing sand, which I should have known. After a few tries, gathering up snow and compacting it between my palms, I managed to throw one that landed with a thud some distance away. While I did not have a target for me to throw it at, I saw how fun it could be and was smiling as I continued back home, trying to trace the footsteps of someone else who walked along the same path as me in the snow.</p> <p>At this point I was happy, wet and tired. A long hot shower was just what I needed before heading to bed &#8211; not before setting up an alarm for early next morning. Even since I was very little, I had always wanted to look out my window and wake up to a white winter morning. And after so many years, I finally saw it. Rooftops covered in a layer of white snow and the sun barely risen to shine enough light for me to take it all in.

I think it&#8217;s fair to say that I really have to work on my motivation to write. My excuse is that I am still getting used to the new environment, but then again, I had time to go on a day trip to Tokyo so that point is probably moot by now.</p> <p>Japan is cold, and it will get colder as the new year approaches, though I&#8217;m probably saying this because I come from and am used to a tropical climate. Along with the cold also comes dryness which results in the bane of my life &#8211; static shocks. I have been consistently shocked every day without fail since I came out of quarantine. The sound of static cling every time I take off my jacket is also starting to fade into the background of my daily routine.</p> <p class="has-text-align-left">Speaking of routine, It&#8217;s been refreshing to finally get out of quarantine, but now that I have work to do, it&#8217;s back to the usual 9 to 5 again. Luckily, My apartment&#8217;s only 5 minutes walk away, which also gave me an idea. I&#8217;ve been starting to jog to my office and back just to get some exercise in and warm up myself at the same time &#8211; didn&#8217;t even break a sweat!</p> <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="122" data-permalink="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/20211212_133243/" data-orig-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211212_133243.jpg" data-orig-size="2256,4032" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;SM-A805F&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1639315963&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.58&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0034965034965035&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="20211212_133243" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211212_133243.jpg?w=168" data-large-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211212_133243.jpg?w=573" src="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211212_133243.jpg?w=573" alt="" class="wp-image-122" width="186" height="333" srcset="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211212_133243.jpg?w=186 186w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211212_133243.jpg?w=372 372w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211212_133243.jpg?w=84 84w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211212_133243.jpg?w=168 168w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px"/><figcaption>Quail Climbing Gym</figcaption></figure></div> <p></p> <p>Although, I have been trying out things to break the monotony of a weekly routine. Barring the first week of settling down, I&#8217;ve been on a hunt for my next regular bouldering gym. First one I&#8217;ve found is <a href="http://quail-climbing.com/">Quail Climbing Gym</a> in Nerima! It&#8217;s not quite as big as I&#8217;d like, but the problems were quite interesting. For newbies, they even have special routes with only marked hand holds. (foot holds are free) Spent my time there as long as I could, but had to call it a day after my grip started to fail me. That&#8217;s when I realised the whole transition period has made me weak. Gonna have to start working on my fundamentals to get back in climbing shape!</p> <p>Also, I took a trip to the famous Tokyo Tower. It was a bit disappointing knowing that there is a newer and taller landmark called the SkyTree, but it was a nice experience nevertheless. The view up there was great, and I even got to get a glimpse of Mount Fuji from there!</p> <figure class="wp-block-embed alignleft is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"> <div class="embed-instagram"><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/CXqQfX5vc-R/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14" style=" background:#FFF;

Arriving in Narita Airport, Tokyo, I look ahead to 2 weeks of solitude, broken only by the company of friends and loved ones through the miracle that is the internet.</p> <p class="has-text-align-left">The decision to move here was made almost 2 years before. I was an intern in a tech company and had the opportunity to meet my current supervisor during an undergraduate conference in Hong Kong. Truth be told, it was not a hard decision to make. I went to her office to pursue a PhD in nuclear physics and agreed immediately at the prospect of travelling to Japan for experiments. The destination may have been decided beforehand, but the journey there was a lot more interesting.</p> <hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-dots"/> <p>I began my studies in Hong Kong, at the height of the pandemic. Honestly speaking, I never expected much from my first year there. Nearly all interactions were muted by the fact that physical events were limited. My only recourse at the time was bouldering, which became a great respite away from my academic work. I frequented a bouldering gym, <a href="https://www.atticv.com.hk/">Attic V</a>, in Wong Chuk Hang. Maybe it&#8217;s because Hong Kong is a cosmopolitan city, being the financial hub bridging the east and the west, but I found myself in the company of more nationalities than I&#8217;ve ever met back in Malaysia. No doubt I&#8217;ve met my fair share of foreigners in the bouldering gym, but I&#8217;ve also met many different and wonderful people during my short tenure in one of HKU&#8217;s dorms.</p> <p>Coming to Hong Kong was the first time I&#8217;ve left Malaysia for a long period of time. To do so while leaving all of my friends and family behind was novel albeit refreshing. I, however, did not plan to stay solitary for the rest of my stay there. Meeting new people from different backgrounds has always been a fond interest of mine. While I was skeptical of my commitment to a club, joining the<a href="https://www.instagram.com/lapcheeambassadors/?hl=en"> Lap Chee Ambassadors </a>was a no brainer &#8211; and I am quite grateful to be able to join them. Not only was I able to meet people from different countries, I was also given the chance to be an interviewer for their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/humans_of_lapchee/?hl=en">Humans of Lap Chee</a> project.</p> <p>Through this project, I have found that no one is really as boring as they think they are. Everyone always has a story to tell. It&#8217;s up to the listener to be willing to give their story a chance and not judge the person for it. Curiosity and having an interest in others also helps a lot in this regard. If you&#8217;ve read this far, then you probably have a healthy dose of both as well.</p> <hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-dots"/> <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img data-attachment-id="34" data-permalink="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/quarantine-view-3/" data-orig-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/quarantine-view-edited-1.jpg" data-orig-size="2256,3010" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;SM-A805F&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1637235604&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.58&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.00065746219592373&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="quarantine-view" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/quarantine-view-edited-1.jpg?w=225" data-large-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/quarantine-view-edited-1.jpg?w=750" src="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/quarantine-view-edited-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-34" width="496"/><figcaption>View from Quarantine</figcaption></figure></div> <p>As I end my writing, I will be in the early stages of my quarantine in Tokyo, Japan.
