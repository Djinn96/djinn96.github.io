Unlike most puzzles in their archive, this was a wordy one.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="786" height="732" data-attachment-id="282" data-permalink="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/2025/03/03/solving-jane-street-feb-2025/image-2/" data-orig-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1.png" data-orig-size="786,732" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1.png?w=750" src="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1.png?w=786" alt="" class="wp-image-282" srcset="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1.png 786w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1.png?w=150 150w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1.png?w=300 300w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 786px) 100vw, 786px"></figure> </div> <p>Right off the bat, the puzzle gives us some clues in the form of position, colour and numbers. On the left, 28 words are neatly organized into 2 groups of 14. While on the left, we see numbers 1 to 14 listed in red and blue, which clues us in that the words are to be separated as red in one group and blue in another.</p> <p>We know that each number likely corresponds to a word from the left, but directly using the words does not make much sense. When have you last heard someone used the words ‘hoagies’ and ‘trionym’? The words are likely scrambled and needs to be rearranged. For this purpose, I found a nice online <a href="https://www.thewordfinder.com/anagram-solver/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">anagram solver</a>.</p> <p>Now I could start with any random word, and maybe this was luck, but I started solving for the word ‘hoagies’, simply because it’s a word I just do not recognize, and it gave me a curious result.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="164" height="146" data-attachment-id="281" data-permalink="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/2025/03/03/solving-jane-street-feb-2025/image/" data-orig-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image.png" data-orig-size="164,146" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image.png?w=164" data-large-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image.png?w=164" src="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image.png?w=164" alt="" class="wp-image-281" srcset="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image.png 164w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image.png?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 164px) 100vw, 164px"></figure> </div> <p>The solver was able to find a new word by removing the letter ‘o’. At this point, I still wasn’t sure what it meant, but looking back at the list of numbers on the right, I noticed that 6 of the 12 lines contain the word ‘the’. and so my next course of action was to google ‘the geisha’.</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="624" data-attachment-id="284" data-permalink="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/2025/03/03/solving-jane-street-feb-2025/image-3/" data-orig-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png" data-orig-size="1275,777" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png?w=750" src="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-284" srcset="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png?w=1024 1024w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png?w=150 150w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png?w=300 300w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png?w=768 768w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.png 1275w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure> <p>And here I made the first breakthrough. The first result is a movie, ‘Memoirs of a Geisha’, which matches the line’7 of a 9′ in the puzzle. Since Geisha fits the blue 9, Memoirs must be a red 7. Putting ‘memoirs’ into the anagram solver returned this.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"> <figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="523" height="148" data-attachment-id="286" data-permalink="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/2025/03/03/solving-jane-street-feb-2025/image-4/" data-orig-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-3.png" data-orig-size="523,148" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-3.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-3.png?w=523" src="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-3.png?w=523" alt="" class="wp-image-286" srcset="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-3.png 523w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-3.png?w=150 150w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-3.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 523px) 100vw, 523px"></figure> </div> <p>To my delight, the first word after removing a letter, ‘isomer’, is one of the word listed in the bottom group! This immediately told me two things. One, the top group corresponds to the blue numbers and vice versa. Two, blue words are solved by taking out one letter before unscrambling, while red words are solved after adding an extra word. Since it is easier to solve the blue words, having all the letters I needed, that’s where I started. ‘The 10 5 3’ was ‘The Empire Strikes Back’ and ‘7 of the 13 6’ became ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’. At this point, another clue was found. The blue 7 ‘admirers’ consisted of the solved word ‘raiders’ + ‘m’, while the red 7 ‘isomer’ is the solved word ‘memoirs’ – ‘m’. So each number corresponds to a letter, and red or blue denotes if the letter is added or removed. </p> <p>With this, the additional letters needed to solve for red words were constricted to those that the blue words discarded. Anglophones will also notice that the list of phrases on the right are movie titles, which made it easier to try to guess which words went where. After making quick work of the remaining answers, I ordered the letters that were ‘given’ and ‘taken’ by their numbers to arrive at ‘FILMCOMPOSERJW’, and the final solution, searching this on google, gave me the film composer, John Williams.</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="391" data-attachment-id="288" data-permalink="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/2025/03/03/solving-jane-street-feb-2025/image-5/" data-orig-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png" data-orig-size="1271,486" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png?w=750" src="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-288" srcset="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png?w=1024 1024w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png?w=150 150w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png?w=300 300w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png?w=768 768w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png 1271w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure> <p>This tracks with the only clue given by Jane Street:</p> <p class="has-text-align-center"><em>[The answer to this puzzle is a proper noun.]</em></p> <p>Additionally, John Williams was also the composer of all 12 movies listed on the right!</p> </body></html>
