Which is to say that I’m not one to check the weather before I leave home. With weather as cold as Japan’s, I was looking forward to see the one thing I have never experienced in my life – snow. Since my arrival here in mid November, I have been keeping track of the temperature and weather for weeks. So you can Imagine the excitement I had when the weather forecast mentioned that snow was expected to fall on a early January morning.</p> <p>But it wasn’t just in the forecast.</p> <p>While I was waiting giddily for snow, there was an unexpected surprise waiting for me as I left my apartment. In almost all fiction material I have read that took place during the winter season, there is a recurring phrase – “frosty morning”. It was on that very morning I was presented with what the phrase meant. All around me as I walked to my lab, there was a slight blueish white tint – too thin to be a fog, too clean to look like a smog. Even the grass knew that snow was coming. Their colours, a muted brown compared to the green I remembered it to be. It was a serene view, one that I believe kept generations of people staying and tolerating cold climate regions.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="140" data-permalink="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/first_snow-1-2/" data-orig-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/first_snow-1-edited.png" data-orig-size="360,639" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="first_snow-1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/first_snow-1-edited.png?w=169" data-large-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/first_snow-1-edited.png?w=360" src="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/first_snow-1-edited.png" alt="" class="wp-image-140" width="335" height="594" srcset="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/first_snow-1-edited.png?w=335&amp;h=594 335w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/first_snow-1-edited.png?w=85&amp;h=150 85w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/first_snow-1-edited.png?w=169&amp;h=300 169w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/first_snow-1-edited.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px"></figure></div> <p>An hour before noon it began. Snow drifted in the wind, falling ever so close to the ground but never seem to touch it. I walked to the cafeteria to get lunch. It was cold, my hands were numb, but my mind never seemed to notice that. All through the walk, my arms were raised to shoulder height, letting the snow fall and accumulate on my jacket. Every flake, large and small, seemed to disappear at the touch of my jacket. Still, they looked soft, fluffy, and not at all what I expected based on my limited knowledge from popular culture. Snow didn’t fall in singular perfectly shaped crystals, they came in clumps, it’s as if someone tore small pieces of white candy floss and threw them all over the place. I went back to my lab, happy but slightly disappointed that the snow was not the white winter I was promised.</p> <p>All I needed was patience.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="143" data-permalink="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/20220106_155805-2/" data-orig-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_155805-edited.jpg" data-orig-size="1268,2256" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"2","credit":"","camera":"SM-A805F","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1641484685","copyright":"","focal_length":"4.58","iso":"80","shutter_speed":"0.01","title":"","orientation":"1"}' data-image-title="20220106_155805" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_155805-edited.jpg?w=169" data-large-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_155805-edited.jpg?w=576" src="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_155805-edited.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-143" width="326" height="580" srcset="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_155805-edited.jpg?w=326&amp;h=580 326w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_155805-edited.jpg?w=652&amp;h=1160 652w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_155805-edited.jpg?w=84&amp;h=150 84w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_155805-edited.jpg?w=169&amp;h=300 169w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_155805-edited.jpg?w=576&amp;h=1024 576w" sizes="(max-width: 326px) 100vw, 326px"></figure></div> <p>Three hours after the snow started to fall, I could tell that the snow was falling harder. Even my limited window view from the office showed me a flurry of white specks shepherded by the wind. Curious, I went back outside to be greeted by a layer of white all around me. the grass was no longer there, replaced by a blanket of snow. The coniferous trees outside now had a top coat, ironically bringing out a bit more colour in them. I took a picture, recorded a short video, and promptly went back to work – I had a meeting coming up.</p> <p>The thing with places far from the equator is that the length of days can vary wildly, and in the winter, night comes far too soon. As I left the building, the sun was out, but the streetlights illuminated another part of the winter landscape. Again I walked, now looking to get dinner. The familiar view, now dark, but with snow reflecting the streetlight and illuminating the area. I took in the sight as I stepped into the snow – ‘crunch’. I think I have found a new favourite sound of mine. The crunch of snow, so loud yet so soothing, making their presence announced with every step of mine and leaving a reminder that someone has been here.</p> <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="132" data-permalink="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/20220106_194555-2/" data-orig-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_194555-edited.jpg" data-orig-size="2256,3008" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"2","credit":"","camera":"SM-A805F","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1641498355","copyright":"","focal_length":"4.58","iso":"2000","shutter_speed":"0.071428571428571","title":"","orientation":"1"}' data-image-title="20220106_194555" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_194555-edited.jpg?w=225" data-large-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_194555-edited.jpg?w=750" src="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_194555-edited.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-132" width="254" height="339" srcset="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_194555-edited.jpg?w=254&amp;h=339 254w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_194555-edited.jpg?w=508&amp;h=678 508w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_194555-edited.jpg?w=113&amp;h=150 113w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220106_194555-edited.jpg?w=225&amp;h=300 225w" sizes="(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px"></figure></div> <p>Dinner warmed me, just enough to keep out the cold – or was it my excitement blinding me from it? And as I walked home, I came upon a patch of thick snow. Of course I am going to build a snowman, can’t let this opportunity get away. So I put on my gloves and got down to it. Granted I had no prior experience of building one, I was surprised that my little one managed to hold itself up, long enough for me to get a picture of it. But there was more snow around, so I tried the next thing I could, throwing snowballs. Turns out throwing snow is a lot like throwing sand, which I should have known. After a few tries, gathering up snow and compacting it between my palms, I managed to throw one that landed with a thud some distance away. While I did not have a target for me to throw it at, I saw how fun it could be and was smiling as I continued back home, trying to trace the footsteps of someone else who walked along the same path as me in the snow.</p> <p>At this point I was happy, wet and tired. A long hot shower was just what I needed before heading to bed – not before setting up an alarm for early next morning. Even since I was very little, I had always wanted to look out my window and wake up to a white winter morning. And after so many years, I finally saw it. Rooftops covered in a layer of white snow and the sun barely risen to shine enough light for me to take it all in. While the next few days saw the snow melt to water, crunchy snow turned to slippery ice, and whiteness fading away, the white winter view will have a place in my memories, always.</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" data-attachment-id="133" data-permalink="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/20220107_063202/" data-orig-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220107_063202.jpg" data-orig-size="4032,2268" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"2","credit":"","camera":"SM-A805F","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1641537122","copyright":"","focal_length":"4.58","iso":"200","shutter_speed":"0.04","title":"","orientation":"1"}' data-image-title="20220107_063202" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220107_063202.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220107_063202.jpg?w=750" src="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220107_063202.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-133" srcset="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220107_063202.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220107_063202.jpg?w=2048 2048w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220107_063202.jpg?w=150 150w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220107_063202.jpg?w=300 300w, https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/20220107_063202.jpg?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure> </body></html>
