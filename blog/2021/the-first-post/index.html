Arriving in Narita Airport, Tokyo, I look ahead to 2 weeks of solitude, broken only by the company of friends and loved ones through the miracle that is the internet.</p> <p class="has-text-align-left">The decision to move here was made almost 2 years before. I was an intern in a tech company and had the opportunity to meet my current supervisor during an undergraduate conference in Hong Kong. Truth be told, it was not a hard decision to make. I went to her office to pursue a PhD in nuclear physics and agreed immediately at the prospect of travelling to Japan for experiments. The destination may have been decided beforehand, but the journey there was a lot more interesting.</p> <hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-dots"> <p>I began my studies in Hong Kong, at the height of the pandemic. Honestly speaking, I never expected much from my first year there. Nearly all interactions were muted by the fact that physical events were limited. My only recourse at the time was bouldering, which became a great respite away from my academic work. I frequented a bouldering gym, <a href="https://www.atticv.com.hk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Attic V</a>, in Wong Chuk Hang. Maybe it’s because Hong Kong is a cosmopolitan city, being the financial hub bridging the east and the west, but I found myself in the company of more nationalities than I’ve ever met back in Malaysia. No doubt I’ve met my fair share of foreigners in the bouldering gym, but I’ve also met many different and wonderful people during my short tenure in one of HKU’s dorms.</p> <p>Coming to Hong Kong was the first time I’ve left Malaysia for a long period of time. To do so while leaving all of my friends and family behind was novel albeit refreshing. I, however, did not plan to stay solitary for the rest of my stay there. Meeting new people from different backgrounds has always been a fond interest of mine. While I was skeptical of my commitment to a club, joining the<a href="https://www.instagram.com/lapcheeambassadors/?hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Lap Chee Ambassadors </a>was a no brainer – and I am quite grateful to be able to join them. Not only was I able to meet people from different countries, I was also given the chance to be an interviewer for their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/humans_of_lapchee/?hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Humans of Lap Chee</a> project.</p> <p>Through this project, I have found that no one is really as boring as they think they are. Everyone always has a story to tell. It’s up to the listener to be willing to give their story a chance and not judge the person for it. Curiosity and having an interest in others also helps a lot in this regard. If you’ve read this far, then you probably have a healthy dose of both as well.</p> <hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-dots"> <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img data-attachment-id="34" data-permalink="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/quarantine-view-3/" data-orig-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/quarantine-view-edited-1.jpg" data-orig-size="2256,3010" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"2","credit":"","camera":"SM-A805F","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1637235604","copyright":"","focal_length":"4.58","iso":"50","shutter_speed":"0.00065746219592373","title":"","orientation":"1"}' data-image-title="quarantine-view" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/quarantine-view-edited-1.jpg?w=225" data-large-file="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/quarantine-view-edited-1.jpg?w=750" src="https://yapjinnming.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/quarantine-view-edited-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-34" width="496"><figcaption>View from Quarantine</figcaption></figure></div> <p>As I end my writing, I will be in the early stages of my quarantine in Tokyo, Japan. Hopefully, the upcoming weeks will be fruitful and my time after that will be even more enjoyable as I dive into the meat of my research. Until next time!</p> </body></html>
